PHP Telnet Sever that opens port 10000 on your computer for people to Telnet into your machine to send messages for the machine to say the message.

Just for a bit of fun.

Run this in terminal e.g. php -q socket_it_to_me.php

Then from other machine Telnet into the host machine on port 100000 e.g. telnet 192.0.0.1 10000
